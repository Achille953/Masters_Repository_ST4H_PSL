# Masters_Repository_ST4H_PSL
Course projects and practical sessions from the ST4H Master's degree.

## 📌 Project Overview
**Objective:** Share healthcare AI/ML projects in Python.

This repository consolidates work developed as part of the AIH track courses for the ST4H Master's program at **PSL University**. It demonstrates the application of Machine Learning algorithms on health data.

## 📂 Repository Contents
The repository is organized by project:

EHR Risk Prediction using MIMIC-IV 3.1 dataset
* 1 **L1 Logistic regression for mortality risk prediction.ipynb**
* 2 **Word2Vec for Clinical Codes Embedding & Logistic Regression mortality prediction.ipynb**
* 3 **LSTM model for Sequential Medical Data & RNNs comparison.ipynb**
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pytorch, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 How to Run
Since these are Jupyter Notebooks, you can view the code and results directly here on GitHub.

To run the code interactively:
1.  Download the specific `.ipynb` file.
2.  Upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3.  Run the cells sequentially.
