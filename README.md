# Masters_Repository_ST4H_PSL
Course projects and practical sessions from the ST4H Master's degree.

## 📌 Project Overview
**Objective:** Share healthcare AI/ML projects in Python.

This repository consolidates work developed as part of the AIH track courses for the ST4H Master's program at **PSL University**. It demonstrates the application of Machine Learning algorithms on health data.

## 📂 Repository Contents
The repository is organized by project:

* **[Name of Notebook 1].ipynb**: [Brief description, e.g., "Predicting heart disease using Logistic Regression."]
* **[Name of Notebook 2].ipynb**: [Brief description, e.g., "Image segmentation on MRI data."]
* **[Name of Notebook 3].ipynb**: [Brief description, e.g., "Time-series analysis of patient vitals."]

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 How to Run
Since these are Jupyter Notebooks, you can view the code and results directly here on GitHub.

To run the code interactively:
1.  Download the specific `.ipynb` file.
2.  Upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3.  Run the cells sequentially.
