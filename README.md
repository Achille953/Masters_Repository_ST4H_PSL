# Masters_Repository_ST4H_PSL
Course projects and practical sessions from the ST4H Master's degree - AI & Digital Health track

## 📌 Project Overview
**Objective:** Share healthcare AI/ML projects in Python.

This repository consolidates work developed as part of the AIH track courses for the ST4H Master's program at **PSL University**. It demonstrates the application of Machine Learning algorithms on health data.

## 📂 Repository Contents
The repository is organized by project:

EHR Risk Prediction using MIMIC-IV 3.1 dataset
1. **L1 Logistic regression for mortality risk prediction.ipynb**
2. **Word2Vec for Clinical Codes Embedding & Logistic Regression mortality prediction.ipynb**
3. **LSTM model for Sequential Medical Data & RNNs comparison.ipynb**
 
Deep Learning for Medical Images Classification in Dermatology
* 1. **CNN for classification of skin cancer images.ipynb**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pytorch, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 How to Run
You can access the data following the guide at the beginning of the notebooks.
Since these are Jupyter Notebooks, you can view the code and results directly here on GitHub.

To run the code interactively:
1.  Download the specific `.ipynb` file.
2.  Upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3.  Run the cells sequentially.
